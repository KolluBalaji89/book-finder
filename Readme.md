## ðŸ§  Problem Faced
I was building a `Book Finder` app and needed help with:
- Creating a modern, responsive UI with plain CSS
- Fetching book data using `fetch` from the Open Library API
- Displaying fallback content when no cover image or results are available
- Structuring the code cleanly using `useState` and conditional rendering

---

## âœ… ChatGPT Helped Me:
- Write clean and accessible CSS for book cards and search bar
- Fix `container` selector to `.container`
- Use fallback `<div class="no-cover">` for missing cover images
- Add search loading state and "No Results Found" fallback
- Suggested better color contrast and responsive input design
