## 🧠 Problem Solving with ChatGPT

### ❓ What I needed help with:
- Building a responsive book card grid layout
- Creating fallback UI when no cover image is available
- Handling empty search results and loading states
- Fixing a CSS bug (`container` was used instead of `.container`)
- Making the input field and button more accessible and responsive

### ✅ What ChatGPT helped me with:
- Fixed invalid CSS selector (`container` ➝ `.container`)
- Added smooth hover effects for buttons
- Used `auto-fill` and `minmax()` for responsive grid
- Suggested conditional rendering for loading and empty results
- Recommended how to structure the JSX code cleanly
- Guided me on how to write this README to explain my approach

## 🙌 Result

With the help of ChatGPT, the app is now:
- Visually clean and responsive
- Robust against edge cases (no image, no results)
- Well-structured for readability and maintainability
